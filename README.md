# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts housing prices using **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**. The project is implemented in Python and makes use of popular data science libraries for preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to use regression algorithms to predict house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, and location. The dataset is processed, visualized, and modeled using two algorithms for comparison.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📁 Files in This Repository

```
.
├── Project_1.ipynb           # Main Jupyter notebook containing the code
├── housing.csv               # Dataset file used for training and testing
└── .ipynb_checkpoints/       # Jupyter notebook checkpoints
```

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted categorical features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions and correlations
3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
4. **Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing_prediction.git
   cd housing_prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Project_1.ipynb
   ```

## ✅ Results

- Linear Regression: R² ≈ _X.XX_
- Random Forest Regressor: R² ≈ _Y.YY_
- Random Forest typically performs better in handling non-linear relationships.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering
- Use of more advanced models like XGBoost or Lasso
